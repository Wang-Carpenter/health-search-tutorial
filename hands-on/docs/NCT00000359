TITLE:
      Treatments for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study was to determine the relative short- and long-term efficacy of
      several physical treatment paradigms commonly employed for the treatment of benign
      paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), including the canalith repositioning (Epley) maneuver,
      the liberatory (Semont) maneuver, the Brandt-Daroff exercises and nonspecific vestibular
      habituation exercises. These procedures involve exercises and head manipulations. Vertigo
      intensity and frequency, the presence/absence of slow-phase eye movements, the degree of
      dizziness handicap and acts of daily living (ADL) were assessed. The study also ascertained
      the effects of co-morbid conditions on the response to treatment. While BPPV is a common and
      significant public health problem that has been recognized for several decades, this is the
      first systematic study of the relative treatment efficacy of different physical treatment
      modalities for this disorder.
