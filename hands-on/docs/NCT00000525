TITLE:
      Diuretics, Hypertension, and Arrhythmias Clinical Trial
SUMMARY:
      To determine whether hypertensive patients with ECG abnormalities and receiving
      hydrochlorothiazide diuretics were at increased risk of sudden death.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      BACKGROUND:

      The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) revealed an unexpected subgroup finding:
      an association between diuretic therapy (especially with hydrochlorothiazide) and an
      increased rate of sudden death in hypertensive men with left ventricular hypertrophy and
      other ECG abnormalities. The Diuretics, Hypertension, and Arrhythmias Clinical Trial sought
      to determine whether the finding resulted from random variation or represented a serious
      toxic response to hydrochlorothiazide.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, double-blind. Following one month of withdrawal from all diuretics and repletion
      with oral potassium and magnesium, the study participants were randomized to two months of
      treatment with one of six treatment groups: hydrochlorothiazide; hydrochlorothiazide with
      oral potassium; hydrochlorothiazide with oral potassium and magnesium; hydrochlorothiazide
      and triamterene; chlorthalidone; or placebo. The main outcome measures were ventricular
      arrhythmias on 24-hour Holter monitoring and serum and intracellular potassium and magnesium
      levels.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Men, ages 35 to 70, with ECG abnormalities, diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg at
        entry.

        Subjects had been treated for at least six months by their own physicians with
        hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), HCT and potassium supplementation, triamteren
