TITLE:
      A Phase I/II Study of Recombinant Interleukin-4 in AIDS and Kaposi's Sarcoma
SUMMARY:
      To determine the safety and tolerance of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in patients with AIDS-related
      Kaposi's sarcoma. To determine the effects of IL-4 on tumor growth in patients with
      AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

      IL-4 exhibits a variety of beneficial effects on the immune system and is a potent inhibitor
      of Kaposi's sarcoma cells in vitro.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      IL-4 exhibits a variety of beneficial effects on the immune system and is a potent inhibitor
      of Kaposi's sarcoma cells in vitro.

      Patients are stratified into two groups according to CD4 count (less than 100 cells/mm3 and
      greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm3) and are enrolled in cohorts of four patients at each
      of four dose levels of IL-4 per stratum. Within each stratum, if patients at a given dose
      level have received at least 2 weeks of study therapy and no more than two patients
      experienced grade 3 or 4 drug-related toxicity, dose escalation in subsequent patients may
      begin. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 50 percent of patients develop grade 3 or
      worse toxicity. Patients with CD4 count less than 500 cells/mm3 (per 12/30/94 amendment)
      must be on antiretroviral therapy during study treatment.

      PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: Group I - enrollment is closed, the objective has been defined.
      Group II - patients must have CD4 cells greater than or equal to 100/mm3 and less than
      500/mm3.

      PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: All patients will receive antiretroviral therapy.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Required:

          -  PCP prophylaxis with TMP/SMX, dapsone, or inhaled pentamidine, if patient has a
             history of PCP or a CD4 count < 250 cells/mm3.

        Allowed only in patients with CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3:

          -  Maintenance doses of ganciclovir, pyrimethamine/sulfa and TMP/SMX for stable,
             well-controlled opportunistic infections.

        Prior Medication: Required: PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95:

          -  Stable dose of antiretroviral therapy required for at least 21 days prior to study
             entry for all patients. (Changed from - Stable dose of antiretroviral therapy for at
             least 21 days prior to study entry in patients with CD4 count < 500 cells/mm3 (per
             12/30/94 amendment).

        Patients must have:

          -  AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

          -  PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: CD4 lymphocyte count >= 100 but < 500 cells/mm3. (Changed
             from - HIV infection.)

          -  PER AMENDMENT 11/20/95: All Patients will receive antiretroviral therapy. (Changed
             from - Current antiretroviral therapy IF CD4 count < 500 cells/mm3 (per 12/30/94
             amendment).)

          -  No active opportunistic infections requiring induction therapy.

          -  Consent of parent or guardian if less than 18 years of age.
