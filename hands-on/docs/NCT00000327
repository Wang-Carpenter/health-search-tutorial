TITLE:
      Buprenorphine/Naloxone Treatment for Opioid Dependence-Experiment I(2) - 2
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy of daily vs. 3-day (MWF)
      buprenorphine/naloxone combination tablet administration and determine whether outcomes are
      improved when using a 3-day schedule in which all doses are ingested at the clinic vs. one
      in which take-home doses are given on intervening days.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Mon/Wed/Fri dosing with the 8 mg buprenorphine/naloxone tablet is as safe and effective as
      daily dosing and is preferred by patients to daily dosing. Multiple doses of the combination
      tablet (e.g. 16mg, 24mg) are well tolerated by patients. A 3 day schedule with take-outs is
      as effective as a 3-day schedule in which all medication is ingested at the clinic
