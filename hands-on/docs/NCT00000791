TITLE:
      A Phase II Double-Blind Study of Two Doses of SC-49483 in Combination With Zidovudine (ZDV) Versus ZDV
SUMMARY:
      To determine the safety and anti-HIV activity of two doses of SC-49483 in combination with
      zidovudine (AZT) versus AZT alone. To determine the influences of viral phenotype on the
      anti-HIV activity of these treatment regimens.

      SC-49483 has no inherent activity against HIV-1 but is converted in the intestinal wall to
      SC-48334, which has demonstrated anti-HIV activity. Since SC-49483 causes significantly less
      gastrointestinal toxicity than SC-48334, the combination of SC-49483 with AZT may improve
      the benefits of both drugs in patients with HIV infection.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      SC-49483 has no inherent activity against HIV-1 but is converted in the intestinal wall to
      SC-48334, which has demonstrated anti-HIV activity. Since SC-49483 causes significantly less
      gastrointestinal toxicity than SC-48334, the combination of SC-49483 with AZT may improve
      the benefits of both drugs in patients with HIV infection.

      Patients are randomized to receive AZT alone or in combination with one of two doses of
      SC-49483, administered three times daily. Treatment continues for 16 to 24 weeks. Per
      07/19/94 amendment: At the end of 24 weeks, blinded treatment continues for an additional 4
      weeks, at which time patients may receive open-label drug on an optional basis for 90 days.
