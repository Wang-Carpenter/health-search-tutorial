TITLE:
      Estrogen Hormone Protocol
SUMMARY:
      Estrogen is a hormone that is dominant in the female reproductive system. In women, most
      estrogen is produced by the ovaries. Men produce estrogen by converting testosterone into
      estrogen. Because this hormone also has many beneficial effects on brain cells, it currently
      is being studied as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The enzyme that forms the
      neurotransmitter acetylcholine is promoted in the presence of estrogen. Several very small
      clinical studies have demonstrated improvement in cognitive function and mood measures in
      women with Alzheimer's disease who take estrogen.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease who currently are not taking estrogen
             replacement therapy, who have had a hysterectomy, and who are in stable general
             health.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an uncontrolled health problem, such as untreated high blood pressure
             or thyroid disease.
