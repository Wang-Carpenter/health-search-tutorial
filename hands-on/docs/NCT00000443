TITLE:
      Ondansetron Treatment for Alcoholism
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to: a) evaluate the effectiveness of ondansetron (Zofran) in
      the treatment of alcohol dependent patients; b) investigate whether early versus late onset
      alcoholism predicts treatment outcome; and c) determine whether the early and late onset
      groups respond differently to treatment. Individuals will be "typed" into early onset and
      late onset alcoholism groups. Individuals will be randomly assigned to a 12-week outpatient
      treatment program.
