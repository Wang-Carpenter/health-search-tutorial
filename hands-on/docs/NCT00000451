TITLE:
      Drug Therapy for Alcohol Dependence in Alaska Natives (Naltrexone/Sertraline)
SUMMARY:
      This study will assess the ability of naltrexone (Revia) to reduce the risk of relapse in
      Alaska natives with alcohol dependence. The study will also examine whether a combination of
      naltrexone and sertraline (Zoloft) yields better abstinence rates than naltrexone used
      alone. Alaska Native individuals will be recruited into a 16 week outpatient study.
