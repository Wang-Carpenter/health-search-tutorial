TITLE:
      Acute Otitis Media: Adjuvant Therapy to Improve Outcome
SUMMARY:
      Acute otitis media is one of the most common diseases of childhood and is one of the major
      causes of hearing loss in children. Despite the availability of effective antibiotic therapy
      for otitis media, treatment failures, persistent effusions, and recurrences are common. This
      Phase III outpatient study aims to test whether adjuvant therapy (an antihistamine or a
      corticosteroid), in addition to antibiotic therapy, improves the acute and long-term
      outcomes of patients with acute otitis media. This study is targeted to recruiting 200
      infants (age less than one year); patient (and parent) participation is estimated to
      continue for one year after enrollment.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had two documented prior episodes of acute otitis media.

          -  Have no current middle ear effusion (fluid).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have chronic otitis media.

          -  Have acute otitis media in addition to chronic otitis media.
