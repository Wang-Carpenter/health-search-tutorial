TITLE:
      Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease
SUMMARY:
      Agitation affects 70 to 90 percent of patients with AD. Signs of agitation include verbal
      and physical aggressiveness, irritability, wandering, and restlessness. These behaviors
      often make caring for patients at home very difficult. Trazodone and haldol are two of the
      most commonly prescribed drugs for agitation in AD patients. Behavior management, a non drug
      approach, has been effective in reducing signs of agitation. Researchers have yet to compare
      the effectiveness of drug versus non drug therapy to treat agitation in AD patients and
      determine which is the best treatment. The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, with
      funding from the National Institute on Aging, is conducting an agitation treatment program
      at 21 sites in 16 States. This study will assess which of the above treatments is most
      effective.
