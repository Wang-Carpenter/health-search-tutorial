TITLE:
      Heterosexual HIV Transmission Study (HATS). Prospective Cohort Study
SUMMARY:
      PRIMARY: To identify factors associated with risk of HIV infection through heterosexual
      activity among urban, inner-city women.

      SECONDARY: To identify correlates of high-risk behaviors in order to provide a basis for
      future intervention studies.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      At baseline and at 6-month intervals, participants are interviewed about their sexual
      behavior, drug and alcohol-related behaviors, and recent medical history, and are given a
      psychosocial assessment. They also undergo a physical exam, including pelvic exam and
      colposcopy, and have blood and urine specimens collected for HIV testing, drug screening,
      and STD evaluation. Additionally, participants are given pre- and post-test counseling and
      education, including information about social services. They are provided with basic
      gynecological care and either treatment or referral for medical problems.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Participants must meet the following criteria:

          -  HIV-negative, sexually active women living in social and sexual proximity to men at
             high risk for acquiring HIV infection.

          -  Able to speak English, Spanish, or Creole.

          -  Living in the geographic area surrounding Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New
             York. (Hospital-based and community-based recruitment sites will be utilized.)

        Personal history of parenteral drug use by self-report or urine test. Heterosexual contact
        with men at high risk for HIV infection.
