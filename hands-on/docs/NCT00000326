TITLE:
      Buprenorphine/Naloxone Treatment for Opioid Dependence-Experiment 1 - 1
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of the buprenorphine/naloxone
      combination tablet for alternate-day dosing and determine whether multiples of the daily
      dose are necessary to maintain an effective alternate day dosing regimen.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Alternate-day dosing with the 8mg buprenorphine-naloxone tablet is as safe and effective as
      daily dosing. Outcomes are improved when the total weekly dose provided during alternate-day
      dosing is equal to that given during daily dosing.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

        Individuals must be currently opioid dependent and meet FDA criteria for narcotic
        maintenance treatment. Co-morbid substance abuse or dependence disorders may also be
        present. Individuals must be healthy despite drug dependency.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Individuals with evidence of an active Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
        Disorders (DSM-IV) Axis I psychiatric disorder (e.g. psychosis, manic-depressive illness,
        organic psychiatric disorders), significant medical illness (e.g. liver or cardiovascular
        disease) or pregnant female subjects are excluded from study participation.
