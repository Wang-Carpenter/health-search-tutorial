TITLE:
      Raynaud's Treatment Study (RTS)
SUMMARY:
      To determine the relative efficacy of usual medical care and a course of treatment by
      thermal biofeedback in reducing vasospastic attacks characteristic of Raynaud's syndrome.
      Also, to confirm the frequency and severity of attacks, examine the role of
      psychophysiological factors in precipitating attacks, and assess the influence of treatment
      on health quality of life.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      BACKGROUND:

      Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is a peripheral vascular disorder resulting in vasospastic
      attacks provoked by cold and/or emotional stress. Attacks most often occur in the fingers,
      but may occur in other extremities as well.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups: slow release Nifedipine,
      a calcium channel blocker; pill placebo; temperature biofeedback; or electromyograph
      biofeedback from the frontalis muscle. The primary endpoint was reduction in number of
      vasospastic attacks. Other endpoints included: other measures of Raynaud's attacks including
      frequency, severity, duration, response to laboratory-based cold challenge, and quality of
      life.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Men and women with documented primary or secondary Raynaud's syndrome.
