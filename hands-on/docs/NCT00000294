TITLE:
      Effects of Carvedilol on Cocaine Use in Humans - 11
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to examine carvedilol effects in response to cocaine.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether carvedilol, and alpha and beta adrenergic
      blocker, would inhibit the priming effect of cocaine in a laboratory model. A total of 12
      subjects were enrolled in this double blind, placebo controlled, outpatient study. After an
      adaptation session, three experimental sessions were held, 2-9 days apart. On each of 3
      experimental sessions, a single oral dose of low (25mg) or high dose of carvedilol (50mg) or
      placebo were administered. Two hours following carvedilol or placebo treatment, subjects
      received a priming dose of smoked cocaine, 0.4 mg/kg. during the second part of the session,
      subjects had the option to earn up to 2 tokens by working on a computer task that could
      later be exchanged for money or deliveries of cocaine. We proposed that blockage of
      adrenergic receptors by carvedilol would significantly alter the subjective and
      physiological effects of cocaine.
